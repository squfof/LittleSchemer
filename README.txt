I learned some Scheme in graduate school, but recently I decided to get myself on firmer ground with the language. As such, I decided to work through "The Little Schemer" by Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen (fourth edition). If you've ever taken a look at this book, you know it is a bit unusual. In particular, it reads like a conversation between two people, unlike the usual expository style you might see in a textbook.

Anyway, I decided to work through the examples in the book and type up my "solutions" to the prompts. The difficulty curve of the text is definitely non-linear. Chapter 9 (where you build the applicative-order Y-combinator) and Chapter 10 (where you build a simple Scheme interpreter) were quite challenging, though most of the first eight chapters is straightforward.

I used Gambit-Scheme (http://gambitscheme.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) to run my code, so there may be slight variations between how I did things and how the authors/anyone else might do these. Also, each chapter starts with code from previous chapters I thought might be needed in the sequel. Because of this, you might need to scroll down a little (or a lot) to see the start of each chapter.

Questions/comments are welcome.
